Describe Async.Promise
  Before all
    let P = vital#vital#import('Async.Promise')
  End

  Describe .new()
    It creates a promise object with proper state
      let p = P.new({resolve -> resolve(0)})
      " 1 means fulfilled
      Assert Equals(p._state, 1)
      Assert HasKey(p, '_vital_promise')

      let p = P.new({_, reject -> reject(0)})
      " 2 means rejected
      Assert Equals(p._state, 2)
      Assert HasKey(p, '_vital_promise')
    End
  End

  Describe .then()
    It calls its callback after synchronized resolution
      let s:done = 0
      call P.new({resolve -> resolve(42)}).then({r -> execute('let s:done = ' . r)})
      let done = s:done
      Assert Equals(done, 42)
    End

    It calls its callback after asynchronized resolution
      let s:done = 0
      call P.new({resolve -> timer_start(50, resolve)}).then({-> execute('let s:done = 42')})
      sleep 100m
      let done = s:done
      Assert Equals(done, 42)
    End
  End
End
